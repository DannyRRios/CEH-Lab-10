<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was all about DoS and DDoS attacks. I first practiced performing a DoS attack (SYN flooding) on a target host using Metasploit, hping3, RavenStorm, HOIC, LOIC. Then, I used Anti DDoS Guardian to prevent attacks from occurring allowing us to block certain IP addresses targeting our network.
